# SQL Visualizer

Constructs a directed acyclic graph from a single SQL query file and renders the
result using mermaid chart notation. Optionally, send the resulting html file to
a browser tab.

Currently, this is no more than a single-use script. There is also a small bug
that occurs with some nodes being marked as source nodes incorrectly.
